## Project Overview

The **NSWC Web Application** is a secure and scalable web platform developed as part of my Senior Capstone Project at Wayne State University. This application allows users to retrieve and compare product data from various Department of Defense (DoD) vendor websites. It also enables users to upload CSV/Excel files for comprehensive results.

### Key Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Seamlessly gather product data from multiple vendors.
- **Comparison Tool**: Compare products side-by-side to aid decision-making.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a focus on usability and accessibility.
- **CSV/Excel Upload**: Users can upload files for additional product comparisons.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Python and libraries like Pandas, PyTorch and NumPy
- **Database**: MySQL
- **APIs**: Integration with vendor APIs (Mouser, Newark, DigiKey, RS Online, Amphenol, Octopart)
